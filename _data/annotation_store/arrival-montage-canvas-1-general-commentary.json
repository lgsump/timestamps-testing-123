This could be an example of how the film makes an interesting choice about what mental or time-space the narrator lives in. In the earlier examples, we know that Louise already has her holistic understanding of time because it was after her interaction with the aliens. So, that leaves us with the question: why is she not sure? Are the creator's leaving it as a question to not give too much away to the viewer? Through this montage she went from \"I used to believe\" to \"I'm not sure anymore\", so is this to give us more answers about why she still has these emotions with her daughter? Is it not because these emotions will exist even with the knowledge of her death, but more that she doesn't completely comprehend that knowledge in the first place? I'm keen to believe that it was a stylistic choice to keep the story more interesting and open-ended in order to be cohesive in the beginning.",
